Parcel lockers have become an increasingly prevalent last-mile delivery method. Yet, a recent study revealed its accessibility
challenges to people with visual impairments (PVI). Informed by the study, we designed FetchAid, a standalone intelligent
mobile app assisting PVI in using a parcel locker in real-time by integrating computer vision and augmented reality (AR)
technologies.

## FetchAid

FetchAid first uses a deep network to detect the userâ€™s fingertip and relevant buttons on the touch screen of the
parcel locker to guide the user to reveal and scan the QR code to open the target compartment door, and then guides the user to
reach the door safely with AR-based context-aware audio feedback. Moreover, FetchAid provides an error-recovery mechanism
and real-time feedback to keep the user on track. <img src="/assets/img/fetchaid-steps.png" alt="iqubes" width="600px" height="200px">
