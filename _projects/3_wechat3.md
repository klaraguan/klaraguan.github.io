My last launched product at WeChat, BHelper, was a data analytics tool for writers and video-makers in WeChat. It summarizes viewers’ statistics, sources, and activities, visualizes data trends, providing valuable insights for content creation.

## BHelper: Key Ideas

As WeChat Search grows, many subscription and video contents are also growing in tandem with the search engine. We want to create a self-contained tool for WeChat content creators that shows them useful information like “how many people have searched for you?”, “how did they find you in WeChat Search? Through what other queries?”, “what other related queries are people searching for?”, etc. We hope that answering these questions for the creators can provide them with some insights on improving their content creating and making their content more popular.

Specifically, we show content creators how many new views and subscribers are achieved through searching. This is shown via two indices: 1) Number of new followers from Search. 2) Number of new views from Search.

We also show the creators how users get to their creations (i.e. what queries did they search to see your creations). For example, other than searching directly for the name of the creator’s channel, users might directly search for keywords in the articles.

In the “data center” page, we also visually show the creators the trends of views and subscribers, as well as the popularity of their contents, which shows them the correlation between search keywords and total views.

Lastly, we point the creators to find the popular queries in Search in different time frames. We hope exposing such information to the creators can help them pivot their creations to appeal to more users.
