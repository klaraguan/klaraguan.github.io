    abstract = {{While parcel locker (KuaiDiGui) has become an increasingly prevalent last-mile delivery method, a recent study revealed its accessibility issues to blind and low vision (BLV) people. Informed by the study, we designed FetchAid, a standalone intelligent mobile app assisting BLV people in using a KuaiDiGui in real-time by integrating computer vision and AR technologies. FetchAid first uses a deep network to detect the user's fingertip and relevant buttons on the touch screen of the KuaiDiGui to guide the user to reveal and scan the QR code to open the target compartment door, and then guides the user to reach the door safely. Moreover, FetchAid provides an error-recovery mechanism and real-time feedback to keep the user on track. We show that FetchAid substantially improved task accomplishment and efficiency, and reduced frustration and overall effort in a study with 12 BLV participants, regardless of their vision conditions and previous experience.}},
