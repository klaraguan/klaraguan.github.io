  abstract={{The rapid adoption of Generative AI (GenAI) is significantly reshaping human cognition, 
  influencing how we engage with information, think, reason, and learn. This paper synthesizes 
  existing literature on GenAI's effects on different aspects of human cognition. Drawing on 
  Krathwohl's revised Bloom's Taxonomy and Dewey's conceptualization of reflective thought, 
  we examine the mechanisms through which GenAI is affecting the development of different 
  cognitive abilities. Accordingly, we provide implications for rethinking and designing 
  educational experiences that foster critical thinking and deeper cognitive engagement 
  and discuss future directions to explore the long-term cognitive effects of GenAI.}}

    abstract = {{Parcel lockers have become an increasingly prevalent last-mile delivery method. Yet, a recent study revealed its accessibility
challenges to people with visual impairments (PVI). Informed by the study, we designed FetchAid, a standalone intelligent
mobile app assisting PVI in using a parcel locker in real-time by integrating computer vision and augmented reality (AR)
technologies. FetchAid first uses a deep network to detect the userâ€™s fingertip and relevant buttons on the touch screen of the
parcel locker to guide the user to reveal and scan the QR code to open the target compartment door, and then guides the user to
reach the door safely with AR-based context-aware audio feedback. Moreover, FetchAid provides an error-recovery mechanism
and real-time feedback to keep the user on track. We show that FetchAid substantially improved task accomplishment and
efficiency, and reduced frustration and overall effort in a study with 12 PVI participants, regardless of their vision conditions
and previous experience.}},
